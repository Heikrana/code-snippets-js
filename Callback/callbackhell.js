/*

-> CallBack hell is well know problem in the old javascript standards. It changed in ES6 with the
   inception of promises (natively supported in ES6 JS)

-> Callback hell occurs when there are a lot of callbacks stacked one after the other in a christmas
   tree like structur
   function1() {
      function2() {
         function3() {
            function4() {
               ... and so on
            }
         }
      }
   }
